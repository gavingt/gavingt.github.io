<p class="caption">To enter a <b>tip amount</b>, say the amount as a price or as a decimal number. For example, if the tip is
    $5.24, you can say "five dollars and twenty-four cents or "five point two four".</p>

<img class="img-with-caption" src="img/voice-input-instructions/2.png"/>
<a name="2"></a>
<p class="caption">To enter a <b>delivery address</b>, simply say the first line of the address. For example, if the full
    address is 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC 20006, you can just say "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue". The app will
    then search for the most likely nearby address that matches what you said.</p>

<img class="img-with-caption" src="img/voice-input-instructions/3.png"/>
<a name="3"></a>
<p class="caption">To enter a <b>delivery address and automatically start navigation</b>, say "navigate to" followed by the address. 
    For example, if the address is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, say "navigate to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue".</p>

<img class="img-with-caption" src="img/voice-input-instructions/4.png"/>
<a name="4"></a>
<p class="caption">To enter a <b>phone number</b>, say each of the numbers individually. For example, if the phone number is
    (555) 498-0719, say "five five five four nine eight zero seven one nine". Make sure you say "zero" and not "ohh" for the number zero.</p>

<img class="img-with-caption" src="img/voice-input-instructions/5.png"/>
<p class="caption">To enter an <b>order price</b>, say the phrase "price equals" followed by the amount. For example, if the
    order price is $16.70, say "price equals 16.7".</p>

<img class="img-with-caption" src="img/voice-input-instructions/6.png"/>
<a name="5"></a>
<p class="caption">To enter a <b>prepaid tip amount</b>, say the phrase "tip amount equals" followed by the amount. For
    example, if the prepaid tip amount is $5.20, say "tip amount equals 5.2".</p>
    
<img class="img-with-caption" src="img/voice-input-instructions/8.png"/>
<a name="6"></a>
<p class="caption">To enter an <b>amount received</b> and have the app calculate your tip amount, you must have already entered an 
    order price. Then you can say the phrase "amount received equals" followed by the amount. For example, if the 
    amount received is $20, say "amount received equals 20".</p>
