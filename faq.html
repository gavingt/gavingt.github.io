<div class="faqHeader">Frequently Asked Questions</div>
<div class="faqSubHeader">for Delivery Tip Tracker</div>
<br>

<div class="faqQuestion">I'm having a problem with the app, or I would like to request a feature. What can I do?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">You can contact me directly at gavingt@gmail.com. I'll respond as soon as possible.</div>
    
<div class="faqQuestion">Is there an iPhone version of Delivery Tip Tracker?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Unfortunately, no. I'm working to become a professional Android developer, so I'm purely focused on Android at the moment.</div>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">I got a new phone. How do I transfer my app data over from my old phone?</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">Using Google Drive makes transferring the app data easy:<br><br>

<div class="videoLink"><i>Note: Google Drive will not upload the backup file from your old phone to the cloud until it's connected to wifi.</i></div>
<br>

Alternatively, if you don't have Google Drive on your phone, you can email the backup file to yourself:<br><br>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">My phone was broken or lost. Can I still restore my app data?</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">The app data is stored on your phone. The app reminds you periodically to back up your app data and store the database backup file on Google Drive. That way your data can always be retrieved.</br></br>Android devices are supposed to automatically back up your app data and store it to Google servers, but these automated backups can fail for a variety of reasons. It's best to make your own backup files to keep your app data safe.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I add an order?</div>
<ol class="orderedList">
	<li class="listItem">Press the 'Start shift' button, and then press the Checkmark icon in the bottom-right to confirm the start of the shift.</li>
	<li class="listItem">From the main screen, enter any optional order info you wish (such as customer phone number, delivery address, etc...).</li>
	<li>Press 'Enter tip amount', enter an amount, and press SUBMIT to add the order.</li>
</ol>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I delete an order?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">From the main screen, simply <a href="https://youtu.be/m7eWo3JyTWk">long-press the order and select "Delete order"</a>. If the order was part of a trip containing multiple orders, the orders dispatched for all orders on the trip will be reduced by 1. 
<br><br>Alternatively, if you just want to remove the most recent order, you can open the menu and select 'Undo last order'. If the order was part of a trip containing multiple orders, the orders dispatched value won't be changed (allowing you to re-enter info for that order).</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How can I view additional order details from the main screen?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Swiping left or right on the list of orders will reveal additional pages of information.</div>


<div class="faqQuestion">If I leave the store with multiple orders, how do I enter the info for all of them at once?</div>
<ol class="orderedList">
	<li class="listItem">Press the 'Orders dispatched' button and select the number of orders you've left the store with.</li>
	<li class="listItem">Expand the UPCOMING ORDERS menu by dragging upwards from the menu near the bottom of the screen.</li>
	<li class="listItem">Enter any info you wish for these orders.</li>
	<li class="listItem">Drag downwards to collapse the UPCOMING ORDERS menu.</li>
	<li>As you deliver each order, enter its tip amount and the app will automatically advance to the next order.</li>
</ol>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">Does the app support split pay wage? My store pays us different rates when on the road versus in the store.</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">It does not. Accurately tracking split pay would require either 1) Constantly tracking the user's location (which would be a huge battery drain), or 2) 
Forcing the user to press a button every time they enter/leave the store. I don't like either of these options.</br></br>Instead, I recommend that you determine your average hourly pay rate and use that value as your 'Hourly pay rate' in the app. You can find your average rate by looking at your paychecks and dividing your wages earned by your hours worked. In my experience, this provides a reasonable approximation of your wages earned.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">A customer paid for their order with a credit card, but tipped me in cash. How do I enter this into the app?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Simply enter the order price, change the 'Payment method' slider to cash, and then enter the tip amount. Pressing the 'Payment method' slider doesn't change any of the values you've already entered.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I view info about my previous shifts in the Free version of the app?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">You'll need the Pro version for that. The Free version only stores the current shift's data.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Why do I occasionally have problems with the app not finding an address, or with the address being in the wrong location?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">The app uses Google's Geocoder service for turning the text you type or speak into full addresses, and then finding the locations of these addresses. Their Geocoder database occasionally returns incorrect results. My app does a lot of processing to try to filter out bad results, and I'm constantly improving these efforts in order to
minimize these erroneous occurences.</br></br>Correctly setting the 'Store radius' from the 'Advanced settings' screen will restrict the searching of addresses only to those near your store. And if all else fails, you can select the address using the 'Pick address from map' feature.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Why are driving distances shown in the app sometimes inaccurate?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Google offers a great service for calculating driving distances. Unfortunately, they charge a ridiculous amount of money to developers for the use of this service. I would be spending far more than I earn if I enabled this service.</br></br>Instead, I use my own algorithm to calculate driving distances. The algorithm uses the starting and ending points of a given trip, and assumes you're travelling in straight lines on a grid. Of course, in the real world things aren't so straightforard. So the algorithm adds a certain percentage to the grid-based estimate to account for things like curves and backtracking. The user can customize this percentage by using the 'Adjust driving distance estimate' option on the 'Advanced settings' screen.</div>
